# WHORTH
The ugly duckling of FORTH

This is curently mostly a terapautic project recovering from long illnes.

It might become usefull thou, and is fun playing with. It's a bastard FORTH currently implemented in python but is planed to be easy to port and to support at least js, wasm to. It use duck typing and have a slightly more complex parser handling strings and parentheses in a saner way while still be word based.

Progress will be sporadic and depending on both recovery and economy.
